## From Theory to Daily Practice

You've learned the fundamentals of cryptographic identity and security. Now let's put it all together into practical, everyday usage of your Nostr identity.

## Setting Up Your Primary Identity

### Identity Planning

Before creating your permanent identity, consider:

#### **Purpose Definition**
- **Main social presence** - Personal thoughts and interactions
- **Professional identity** - Work-related content and networking
- **Creative identity** - Art, music, writing, or other creative work
- **Anonymous identity** - Privacy-focused discussions

#### **Longevity Considerations**
- **Long-term commitment** - This identity could last years or decades
- **Reputation building** - Consistent presence builds trust
- **Network effects** - Followers and connections have value
- **Migration complexity** - Changing identities later is difficult

### Secure Identity Creation

Let's create your primary Nostr identity using best practices:

#### Step 1: Secure Environment Setup

```bash
# Create a clean, secure environment
mkdir secure-identity-creation
cd secure-identity-creation

# Ensure you're in a secure location (private network, updated system)
# Consider using a dedicated device or fresh OS installation for high-value identities
```

#### Step 2: Generate Production Keys

=== "JavaScript (Recommended)"

    ```javascript
    import { generatePrivateKey, getPublicKey, nip19 } from 'nostr-tools'
    
    // Generate your permanent identity
    console.log('üîê Generating your permanent Nostr identity...')
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è  This will be your long-term digital identity')
    console.log('')
    
    const privateKey = generatePrivateKey()
    const publicKey = getPublicKey(privateKey)
    
    const nsec = nip19.nsecEncode(privateKey)
    const npub = nip19.npubEncode(publicKey)
    
    console.log('=== YOUR PERMANENT NOSTR IDENTITY ===')
    console.log(`Private Key (nsec): ${nsec}`)
    console.log(`Public Key (npub): ${npub}`)
    console.log('')
    console.log('üö® CRITICAL: Backup these keys immediately!')
    console.log('üö® Test your backup recovery process!')
    console.log('üö® Never share your private key with anyone!')
    
    // Generate verification event
    const verificationEvent = {
        kind: 1,
        created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
        tags: [],
        content: `Verifying my new Nostr identity. Generated on ${new Date().toISOString()} #newidentity #verification`
    }
    
    console.log('')
    console.log('Test event to verify key works:')
    console.log(JSON.stringify(verificationEvent, null, 2))
    ```

#### Step 3: Immediate Backup Implementation

**Before doing anything else**, implement your backup strategy:

1. **Digital backup** - Encrypted storage in password manager
2. **Physical backup** - Written on paper, stored securely
3. **Test recovery** - Verify you can actually recover keys
4. **Secure deletion** - Remove keys from generation computer

### Profile Setup Best Practices

#### Metadata Event (Kind 0)

Your profile information is stored in a Nostr event:

=== "JavaScript Example"

    ```javascript
    import { finishEvent } from 'nostr-tools'
    
    const profileEvent = finishEvent({
        kind: 0,
        created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
        tags: [],
        content: JSON.stringify({
            name: "Your Display Name",
            about: "Brief description of who you are and what you're interested in. Keep it authentic and engaging.",
            picture: "https://example.com/your-profile-image.jpg",
            banner: "https://example.com/your-banner-image.jpg",
            nip05: "yourname@yourdomain.com",
            lud16: "yourname@getalby.com", // Lightning address for zaps
            website: "https://yourwebsite.com"
        })
    }, privateKey)
    
    console.log('Profile event:', profileEvent)
    ```

#### Profile Content Guidelines

**Name Field**
- **Keep it consistent** across platforms when possible
- **Make it memorable** but professional
- **Consider searchability** - how people will find you

**About Section**
- **Clear and concise** description of your interests
- **Include relevant hashtags** for discoverability
- **Update periodically** as your focus evolves
- **Be authentic** - genuine connections matter more than perfect copy

**Profile Images**
- **High quality** images that represent you well
- **Appropriate for your audience** and purpose
- **Consistent branding** across your digital presence
- **Proper licensing** - only use images you have rights to

### Multi-Client Setup

- **Consider future implications** - how might this age?
- **Protect others' privacy** - don't share others' information
- **Maintain appropriate boundaries** - personal vs. public information

## Managing Multiple Identities

### When to Use Multiple Identities

#### Legitimate Use Cases
**Compartmentalization**
- **Personal vs. Professional** - different audiences and content types
- **Anonymous discussions** - sensitive topics requiring privacy
- **Testing and development** - experimenting without affecting main identity
- **Creative projects** - separate artistic or creative personas

**Security Reasons**
- **High-value identity protection** - reduce attack surface
- **Operational security** - separate identities for different threat models
- **Recovery scenarios** - backup identities for emergency communication

### Multiple Identity Management

#### Organization System
```
Identity Management Spreadsheet:
- Identity Purpose (Personal, Professional, Anonymous, Testing)
- Public Key (npub)
- Creation Date
- Primary Client
- Backup Status
- Last Used
- Notes
```

#### Security Considerations
- **Separate key storage** - don't store all identities together
- **Different security levels** - match security to identity value
- **Isolated usage** - avoid linking identities accidentally
- **Documentation** - clear records of what each identity is for

#### Operational Guidelines
- **Clear context switching** - know which identity you're using
- **Consistent personas** - maintain character of each identity
- **Cross-contamination prevention** - avoid accidentally linking identities
- **Lifecycle management** - plan for creation and retirement of identities

## Verification and Trust

### NIP-05 Verification

Link your Nostr identity to a domain you control:

#### Setup Process
1. **Control a domain** - own or have access to domain configuration
2. **Create verification file** - JSON file with your public key
3. **Upload to your domain** - at `/.well-known/nostr.json`
4. **Update profile** - add NIP-05 identifier to your profile
5. **Verify functionality** - test that verification works

#### Verification File Example
```json
{
  "names": {
    "yourname": "your-hex-public-key-here"
  }
}
```

### Building Trust and Reputation

#### Verification Strategies
- **Domain verification** - Link to websites you control
- **Cross-platform consistency** - Same identity across social platforms
- **Long-term presence** - Consistent activity over time
- **Community engagement** - Meaningful participation in discussions

#### Web of Trust
- **Mutual follows** with trusted accounts
- **Recommendations** from respected community members
- **Consistent behavior** that builds confidence over time
- **Transparency** about your identity and motivations where appropriate
