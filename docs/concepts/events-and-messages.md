# Events and Messages in Nostr

!!! info "Learning Objectives"
    After this lesson, you'll understand:
    
    - How everything in Nostr is structured as events
    - Different types of events and their purposes
    - Event structure and required fields
    - How events are signed and verified
    - Common event kinds and their use cases

## Understanding Events

In Nostr, **everything is an event**. Whether you're posting a text note, updating your profile, reacting to a post, or sending a direct message - it's all structured as events.

This unified approach provides several benefits:

- **Consistency**: All data follows the same structure
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added as new event types
- **Simplicity**: One format to rule them all
- **Interoperability**: All clients understand the same basic structure

## Event Structure

Every Nostr event is a JSON object with specific required fields:

```json
{
  "id": "event-id-hash",
  "pubkey": "author-public-key", 
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [],
  "content": "Hello Nostr!",
  "sig": "cryptographic-signature"
}
```

Let's break down each field:

### Required Fields

#### **`id`** (Event ID)
- 32-byte SHA-256 hash of the serialized event data
- Serves as the unique identifier for the event
- Calculated from other fields (not arbitrary)

```javascript
// The ID is the SHA-256 of this serialized data:
[
  0,                    // Reserved
  pubkey,              // Author public key
  created_at,          // Timestamp
  kind,                // Event type
  tags,                // Tags array
  content              // Event content
]
```

#### **`pubkey`** (Author)
- 32-byte public key of the event creator
- Identifies who created the event
- Used to verify the signature

#### **`created_at`** (Timestamp)
- Unix timestamp in seconds
- When the event was created
- Used for chronological ordering

#### **`kind`** (Event Type)
- Integer that defines the event type
- Determines how clients should interpret the event
- Standardized in various NIPs

#### **`tags`** (Metadata)
- Array of arrays containing metadata
- Used for references, mentions, hashtags, etc.
- Each tag is an array of strings

#### **`content`** (Message Content)
- The main content of the event
- Can be text, JSON, or empty depending on kind
- Often contains the user-visible message

#### **`sig`** (Signature)
- 64-byte Schnorr signature
- Proves the event was created by the pubkey owner
- Prevents tampering

## Event Kinds

Event kinds determine how the event should be interpreted:

### Text Events

#### **Kind 1: Text Note**
The most common event type - like a tweet:

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "content": "Just learned about Nostr! This decentralized social media is amazing ðŸš€",
  "tags": [
    ["t", "nostr"],
    ["t", "decentralized"]
  ]
}
```

#### **Kind 0: User Metadata**
Profile information:

```json
{
  "kind": 0,
  "content": "{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"about\":\"Nostr enthusiast\",\"picture\":\"https://example.com/avatar.jpg\"}"
}
```

### Social Events

#### **Kind 7: Reaction**
Likes, hearts, and other reactions:

```json
{
  "kind": 7,
  "content": "ðŸ¤™",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "note-id-being-reacted-to"],
    ["p", "author-of-original-note"]
  ]
}
```

#### **Kind 6: Repost**
Sharing someone else's note:

```json
{
  "kind": 6,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "event-id-being-reposted"],
    ["p", "original-author-pubkey"]
  ]
}
```

### Communication Events

#### **Kind 4: Encrypted Direct Message**
Private messages between users:

```json
{
  "kind": 4,
  "content": "encrypted-message-content",
  "tags": [
    ["p", "recipient-pubkey"]
  ]
}
```

#### **Kind 42: Channel Message**
Public chat room messages:

```json
{
  "kind": 42,
  "content": "Hello everyone in this channel!",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "channel-creation-event-id", "", "root"]
  ]
}
```

### Management Events

#### **Kind 3: Contact List**
Who you follow:

```json
{
  "kind": 3,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["p", "pubkey1", "relay-url", "petname"],
    ["p", "pubkey2", "relay-url", "alice"]
  ]
}
```

#### **Kind 5: Event Deletion**
Request to delete your own events:

```json
{
  "kind": 5,
  "content": "Deleting this post",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "event-id-to-delete"],
    ["k", "1"]
  ]
}
```

### Advanced Events

#### **Kind 30023: Long-form Content**
Articles and blog posts:

```json
{
  "kind": 30023,
  "content": "# My Article\n\nThis is a long-form article...",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "my-article-slug"],
    ["title", "My Amazing Article"],
    ["summary", "A brief summary"],
    ["published_at", "1234567890"]
  ]
}
```

#### **Kind 9735: Zap**
Lightning payments:

```json
{
  "kind": 9735,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["bolt11", "lightning-invoice"],
    ["description", "zap-request-event"],
    ["p", "recipient-pubkey"]
  ]
}
```

## Tag System

Tags provide structured metadata for events:

### Common Tag Types

#### **"e" tags** - Event References
Reference other events:

```json
["e", "event-id", "relay-url", "marker", "pubkey"]
```

- `event-id`: The event being referenced
- `relay-url`: Where to find the event (optional)
- `marker`: "root", "reply", or "mention" (optional)
- `pubkey`: Author of referenced event (optional)

#### **"p" tags** - Pubkey References
Reference users:

```json
["p", "pubkey", "relay-url", "petname"]
```

#### **"t" tags** - Topics/Hashtags
Categorize content:

```json
["t", "nostr"]
["t", "bitcoin"]
```

#### **"d" tags** - Identifiers
For replaceable events:

```json
["d", "unique-identifier"]
```

### Advanced Tags

```json
// Content warning
["content-warning", "reason"]

// Expiration
["expiration", "unix-timestamp"]

// Subject line
["subject", "Email-like subject"]

// Geographic location
["g", "geohash"]
```

## Event Creation Process

### 1. Build Event Object

```javascript
const event = {
  kind: 1,
  created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  tags: [
    ["t", "nostr"],
    ["p", "some-pubkey"]
  ],
  content: "Hello Nostr!"
}
```

### 2. Add Pubkey

```javascript
event.pubkey = getPublicKey(privateKey)
```

### 3. Calculate ID

```javascript
import { getEventHash } from 'nostr-tools'

event.id = getEventHash(event)
```

### 4. Sign Event

```javascript
import { signEvent } from 'nostr-tools'

event.sig = signEvent(event, privateKey)
```

### 5. Publish to Relays

```javascript
relays.forEach(relay => {
  relay.publish(event)
})
```

## Event Verification

When receiving events, clients must verify them:

### 1. Verify ID

```javascript
import { getEventHash } from 'nostr-tools'

const calculatedId = getEventHash(event)
if (calculatedId !== event.id) {
  throw new Error('Invalid event ID')
}
```

### 2. Verify Signature

```javascript
import { verifySignature } from 'nostr-tools'

const isValid = verifySignature(event)
if (!isValid) {
  throw new Error('Invalid signature')
}
```

### 3. Check Timestamp

```javascript
const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
const age = now - event.created_at

// Reject events too far in the future
if (event.created_at > now + 60) {
  throw new Error('Event from future')
}

// Optionally reject very old events
if (age > 86400 * 30) { // 30 days
  console.warn('Very old event')
}
```

## Event Serialization

Events must be serialized consistently for ID calculation:

```javascript
// Serialization for ID calculation
const serialized = JSON.stringify([
  0,
  event.pubkey,
  event.created_at,
  event.kind,
  event.tags,
  event.content
])

// No whitespace, specific character escaping
const id = sha256(utf8Encode(serialized))
```

### Character Escaping Rules

Specific characters must be escaped in content:

- Line break (`0x0A`) â†’ `\n`
- Double quote (`0x22`) â†’ `\"`
- Backslash (`0x5C`) â†’ `\\`
- Carriage return (`0x0D`) â†’ `\r`
- Tab (`0x09`) â†’ `\t`
- Backspace (`0x08`) â†’ `\b`
- Form feed (`0x0C`) â†’ `\f`

## Event Relationships

Events can reference each other to create complex structures:

### Threads (Replies)

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "content": "This is a reply",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "root-event-id", "", "root"],
    ["e", "parent-event-id", "", "reply"],
    ["p", "original-author-pubkey"],
    ["p", "parent-author-pubkey"]
  ]
}
```

### Mentions

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "content": "Hey #[0], check this out!",
  "tags": [
    ["p", "mentioned-user-pubkey"]
  ]
}
```

### Quotes

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "content": "This is interesting: nostr:note1abc...",
  "tags": [
    ["q", "quoted-event-id"]
  ]
}
```

## Replaceable Events

Some events can be replaced by newer versions:

### Regular Replaceable (10000-19999)
Only the latest event for each `kind` + `pubkey` is kept:

```json
{
  "kind": 10000,
  "content": "My mute list",
  "tags": [
    ["p", "muted-pubkey-1"],
    ["p", "muted-pubkey-2"]
  ]
}
```

### Parameterized Replaceable (30000-39999)
Latest event for each `kind` + `pubkey` + `d` tag:

```json
{
  "kind": 30023,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "my-article-slug"],
    ["title", "My Article"]
  ],
  "content": "Article content..."
}
```

## Event Validation Rules

### Required Validations

- `id` matches SHA-256 of serialized event
- `sig` is valid Schnorr signature
- `pubkey` is valid 32-byte hex
- `created_at` is reasonable timestamp
- `kind` is valid integer
- `tags` is array of arrays of strings

### Optional Validations

- Content length limits
- Tag count limits
- Timestamp freshness
- Proof of work requirements
- Content filtering

## Working with Events in Code

### Creating a Text Note

```javascript
import { finishEvent } from 'nostr-tools'

const event = finishEvent({
  kind: 1,
  created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  tags: [
    ["t", "hello"],
    ["t", "nostr"]
  ],
  content: "Hello Nostr world! ðŸ‘‹"
}, privateKey)

console.log('Created event:', event)
```

### Creating a Reply

```javascript
const replyEvent = finishEvent({
  kind: 1,
  created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  tags: [
    ["e", originalEvent.id, "", "root"],
    ["p", originalEvent.pubkey]
  ],
  content: "Great post! Thanks for sharing."
}, privateKey)
```

### Creating a Reaction

```javascript
const reaction = finishEvent({
  kind: 7,
  created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  tags: [
    ["e", noteEvent.id],
    ["p", noteEvent.pubkey],
    ["k", "1"] // kind of event being reacted to
  ],
  content: "ðŸ¤™"
}, privateKey)
```

## Best Practices

### For Event Creation

!!! success "Do This"
    - Always set reasonable `created_at` timestamps
    - Include relevant `p` tags for notifications
    - Use standard tag formats
    - Keep content size reasonable
    - Include proper event references in replies

!!! danger "Avoid This"
    - Creating events with future timestamps
    - Omitting required `p` tags in replies
    - Using non-standard tag formats
    - Creating excessive tag noise
    - Forgetting to handle special characters

### For Event Processing

- Always verify signatures before trusting events
- Implement reasonable timestamp checks
- Handle missing or malformed fields gracefully
- Cache verification results for performance
- Rate limit event processing to prevent spam

## Common Patterns

### Thread Creation

```javascript
// Root post
const rootPost = finishEvent({
  kind: 1,
  content: "Starting a new thread about Nostr events...",
  // ...
}, privateKey)

// Reply to root
const reply = finishEvent({
  kind: 1,
  content: "First point: events are the core data structure",
  tags: [
    ["e", rootPost.id, "", "root"],
    ["p", rootPost.pubkey]
  ]
  // ...
}, privateKey)
```

### Content Discovery

```javascript
// Subscribe to hashtag
const sub = relay.sub([{
  kinds: [1],
  "#t": ["nostr"]
}])

// Subscribe to mentions
const mentionSub = relay.sub([{
  kinds: [1],
  "#p": [myPubkey]
}])
```

### Event Updates

```javascript
// Replaceable event (profile)
const profile = finishEvent({
  kind: 0,
  content: JSON.stringify({
    name: "Alice",
    about: "Nostr developer",
    picture: "https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
  })
  // ...
}, privateKey)
```

## Next Steps
