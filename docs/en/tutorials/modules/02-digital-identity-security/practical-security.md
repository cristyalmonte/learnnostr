## Beyond Key Generation: Operational Security

You've learned to generate and store keys securely. Now let's cover the ongoing security practices that keep your digital identity safe in real-world use.

!!! warning "Security is a Process"
    Security isn't a one-time setup - it's an ongoing practice. The strongest cryptography in the world won't help if you get careless with operational security.

## Backup Strategies

### The 3-2-1 Rule

For critical data like your Nostr keys, follow the **3-2-1 backup rule**:

- **3** copies of your data (original + 2 backups)
- **2** different types of media (digital + physical)
- **1** offsite backup (different location)

### Multiple Backup Types

#### Type 1: Digital Encrypted Backups

**Password Manager**
```
‚úÖ Pros: Always accessible, encrypted, synced across devices
‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Single point of failure if master password compromised
üéØ Use for: Primary access and daily use
```

**Encrypted Files**
```bash
# GPG encrypted backup
echo "nsec1your-private-key" | gpg --symmetric --armor > backup.asc

# Password-protected ZIP
zip -e nostr-backup.zip keys.txt

# OpenSSL encryption
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in keys.txt -out keys.enc
```

#### Type 2: Physical Backups

**Steel Plates**
- **Fireproof and waterproof** - survives disasters
- **Tamper-evident** - physical security
- **Long-term durability** - decades of storage
- **Products**: Cryptosteel, SteelWallet, Blockplate

**Paper Backups**
- **Multiple copies** in different locations
- **Archival quality paper** and permanent ink
- **Laminated protection** from water damage
- **Safe deposit boxes** or fireproof safes

#### Type 3: Distributed Backups

**Shamir's Secret Sharing**
Split your key into multiple parts:

```python
# Example concept (don't use in production without proper implementation)
# Split key into 5 parts, any 3 can recover
shares = split_secret(private_key, threshold=3, total_shares=5)

# Distribute shares to trusted parties/locations
# Family members, safety deposit boxes, etc.
```

**Geographic Distribution**
- **Home safe** - everyday access
- **Bank safety deposit box** - secure offsite
- **Trusted family member** - emergency access
- **Second home/office** - redundant offsite

### üõ†Ô∏è Hands-on: Create Your Backup System

Let's implement a complete backup strategy:

#### Step 1: Create Encrypted Digital Backup

=== "Using GPG"

    ```bash
    # Create master backup file
    cat > nostr-identity.txt << EOF
    # Nostr Identity Backup
    # Generated: $(date)
    # 
    # Private Key (nsec): nsec1your-key-here
    # Public Key (npub): npub1your-key-here
    # 
    # KEEP THIS FILE SECURE
    EOF
    
    # Encrypt with strong passphrase
    gpg --symmetric --armor nostr-identity.txt
    
    # This creates nostr-identity.txt.asc - the encrypted version
    # Store this in multiple secure locations
    ```

=== "Using Age (Modern Alternative)"

    ```bash
    # Install age: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age
    
    # Create backup and encrypt
    echo "nsec1your-key-here" | age -p > nostr-backup.age
    
    # Decrypt when needed
    age -d nostr-backup.age
    ```

#### Step 2: Create Physical Backup

```
NOSTR IDENTITY BACKUP
Generated: [DATE]

Private Key: nsec1[write full key here]
Public Key: npub1[write full key here]

Checksum: [last 8 characters of private key]

‚ö†Ô∏è  ANYONE WITH PRIVATE KEY CONTROLS THIS IDENTITY
‚ö†Ô∏è  STORE IN SECURE LOCATION
‚ö†Ô∏è  NEVER PHOTOGRAPH OR SCAN
```

#### Step 3: Test Recovery Process

**Critical step**: Regularly test that you can actually recover your keys!

```bash
# Recovery test checklist:
# [ ] Can decrypt digital backup
# [ ] Can read physical backup clearly
# [ ] Keys work to sign messages
# [ ] All backup locations accessible
# [ ] Recovery process documented
```

4. **Success criteria** (how to verify completion)

**Example:**
```
‚ùå Steel backup created
Priority: High (valuable identity)
Resources: $100, 2 hours research + setup
Timeline: This month
Success: Keys stamped on steel, stored in bank safe
```

## üìù Knowledge Check

!!! question "Test Your Understanding"
    
    **1. What is the 3-2-1 backup rule and why is it important?**
    
    ??? success "Answer"
        3 copies of your data, 2 different types of media, 1 offsite backup. This provides redundancy against multiple failure modes - if one backup fails, you have others. Different media types protect against technology failures, and offsite protects against disasters.
    
    **2. Why should you never take screenshots of your private keys?**
    
    ??? success "Answer"
        Screenshots are automatically backed up to cloud services, can be accidentally shared, and create digital copies that are harder to secure than properly encrypted text. They also often lack context about what they contain, making them easier to mishandle.
    
    **3. What should you do immediately if you suspect your private key has been compromised?**
    
    ??? success "Answer"
        Generate new keys immediately, announce the migration to your network, update all applications to use new keys, revoke old keys where possible, and analyze how the compromise happened to prevent recurrence.
