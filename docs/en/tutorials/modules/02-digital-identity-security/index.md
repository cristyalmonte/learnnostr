# Module 2: Digital Identity & Security üîê

!!! info "Module Overview"
    **Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
    **Prerequisites:** Module 1 completed  
    **Skill Level:** Foundation  
    **Module Type:** Technical Fundamentals + Security

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- [ ] Understand how public-key cryptography creates digital identity
- [ ] Generate, manage, and secure your cryptographic keys
- [ ] Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Recognize and avoid common security pitfalls
- [ ] Use your digital identity confidently across the Nostr network

## Why This Module Matters

Your cryptographic keys ARE your identity in Nostr. Unlike traditional platforms where your account can be recovered through email or phone verification, losing your Nostr keys means losing your identity permanently. This module ensures you understand both the power and responsibility that comes with true digital ownership.

## Real-World Impact

After completing this module, you'll have skills that extend beyond Nostr:
- Understanding of modern digital security
- Confidence with cryptocurrency wallets
- Knowledge applicable to other decentralized protocols
- Ability to help others navigate digital identity safely

## Security Warning

!!! danger "Critical Information"
    This module deals with cryptographic secrets that control your digital identity. Take your time, follow instructions carefully, and never share your private keys with anyone.
    
    **Key Points:**
    - Private keys cannot be recovered if lost
    - No customer service can help you if you lose access
    - Your keys are your responsibility alone
    - Start with test keys while learning

## Success Criteria

Before moving to Module 3, ensure you can:

- [ ] Explain how public-key cryptography works to a friend
- [ ] Generate keys securely using multiple methods
- [ ] Store and backup keys using best practices
- [ ] Recover your identity from backups
- [ ] Use your identity confidently across different applications
