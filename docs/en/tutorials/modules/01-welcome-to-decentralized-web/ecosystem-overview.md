4. **Innovation:** Which use cases beyond social media seem most promising for Nostr?

5. **Community:** What role should different stakeholders (developers, users, businesses) play in ecosystem growth?

## üìù Knowledge Check

!!! question "Test Your Understanding"
    
    **1. What makes the Nostr ecosystem different from traditional app ecosystems?**
    
    ??? success "Answer"
        Everything is open source, applications interoperate through a shared protocol, users own their identity across all apps, and economic models are based on direct value exchange rather than advertising.
    
    **2. How do NIPs (Nostr Implementation Possibilities) work?**
    
    ??? success "Answer"
        NIPs are community-proposed improvements to the protocol that go through review and discussion before being voluntarily adopted by clients and relays. There's no central authority mandating changes.
    
    **3. What role does Lightning Network integration play in the ecosystem?**
    
    ??? success "Answer"
        Lightning enables micropayments, direct creator monetization, and new economic models that make sustainable growth possible without advertising or data harvesting.
