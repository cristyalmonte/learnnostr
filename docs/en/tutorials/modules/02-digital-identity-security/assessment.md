## üìù Knowledge Assessment

### Part 1: Cryptographic Fundamentals

!!! question "Question 1"
    **Explain the mathematical relationship between private and public keys. Why is this relationship "one-way"?**
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        Public keys are derived from private keys using elliptic curve cryptography (specifically secp256k1). The relationship is "one-way" because while it's computationally easy to derive a public key from a private key (milliseconds), the reverse operation (finding the private key from a public key) is computationally infeasible - it would take longer than the age of the universe with current technology.

!!! question "Question 2"
    **How do digital signatures prove identity without revealing the private key?**
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        Digital signatures use the private key to sign a hash of the message, creating a unique signature. This signature can be verified using the public key, proving that only the holder of the corresponding private key could have created it. The signature doesn't reveal the private key itself - it's mathematically impossible to derive the private key from the signature.

### Part 2: Key Management

!!! question "Question 3"
    **What makes a random number generator "cryptographically secure" and why does this matter for key generation?**
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        A cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) is unpredictable, non-reproducible, and has high entropy drawn from hardware-based sources. This matters because predictable or low-entropy key generation can be exploited by attackers who could guess or brute-force your private key.

!!! question "Question 4"
    **Describe the 3-2-1 backup rule and explain why each component is important.**
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        3 copies of your data (original + 2 backups), 2 different types of media (digital + physical), 1 offsite backup. This provides redundancy against multiple failure modes: if one backup fails you have others, different media protects against technology failures, and offsite protects against disasters like fire or theft.

### Part 3: Security Practices

!!! question "Question 5"
    **What are the key differences between hex and bech32 key formats, and when should you use each?**
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        Hex format is the raw 64-character format (0-9, a-f) used internally by applications. Bech32 format (nsec/npub) includes error detection, human-readable prefixes, and is safer for manual entry and sharing. Use hex for internal processing and APIs, bech32 for user interfaces, sharing, and manual backup.

!!! question "Question 6"
    **Why should you never take screenshots of your private keys, even if you plan to delete them?**
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        Screenshots are automatically backed up to cloud services, can be accidentally shared, create digital copies that are harder to secure than properly encrypted text, often lack context about their sensitive nature, and may be stored in device memory or cache even after deletion.
