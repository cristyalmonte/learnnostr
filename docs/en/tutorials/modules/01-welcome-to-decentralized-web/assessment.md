## üìù Knowledge Assessment

### Part 1: Understanding the Problems

!!! question "Question 1"
    **What are the five core problems with centralized social media platforms?**
    
    (List all five and briefly explain each)
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        1. **Censorship and Content Control** - Platforms can silence voices or remove content
        2. **Algorithmic Manipulation** - AI decides what you see based on engagement, not your preferences
        3. **Data Harvesting and Privacy Invasion** - Your data is collected and sold without fair compensation
        4. **Platform Lock-in and Lost Audiences** - You can't take your followers when you leave
        5. **Single Points of Failure** - When the platform goes down, everyone loses access

!!! question "Question 2"
    **Why can't traditional social media platforms easily solve these problems?**
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        These problems are features, not bugs, of their business model. They make money from data collection, algorithmic manipulation, and keeping users locked in. Solving these problems would require fundamental changes to how they operate and generate revenue.

### Part 2: Understanding Decentralization

!!! question "Question 3"
    **What's the difference between a federated system (like Mastodon) and a truly decentralized protocol (like Nostr)?**
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        Federated systems still have server-based identities - your identity is tied to a specific server. Nostr uses cryptographic keys for identity that work across the entire network, making it truly portable and decentralized.

!!! question "Question 4" 
    **How is Nostr like email in terms of decentralization?**
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        Like email, Nostr is an open protocol where different providers (relays) can interoperate. Gmail users can email Yahoo users, just like Damus users can communicate with Iris users. No single company controls the entire network.

### Part 3: Nostr Fundamentals

!!! question "Question 5"
    **What does NOSTR stand for and what does each part mean?**
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        **N**otes and **O**ther **S**tuff **T**ransmitted by **R**elays. Notes = primary content, Other Stuff = media/reactions/etc, Transmitted = protocol communication, Relays = the server infrastructure.

!!! question "Question 6"
    **What are the three main components of the Nostr network?**
    
    ??? success "Answer Key"
        1. **Events** - The data structures that contain all content
        2. **Relays** - Servers that store and forward events  
        3. **Clients** - Applications that provide user interfaces

### Part 4: Practical Experience

!!! question "Question 7"
    **Describe your experience using the same identity across multiple Nostr clients. How did this feel different from traditional social media?**
    
    ??? success "Sample Answer"
        The identity portability was amazing - I could instantly access the same profile, posts, and followers across different apps without any setup or data migration. This felt completely different from traditional social media where each platform requires a separate account and you lose everything if you want to switch.

!!! question "Question 8"
    **What types of applications in the Nostr ecosystem surprised you the most?**
    
    ??? success "Sample Answer"
        Answers will vary, but might include: music streaming with micropayments (Wavlake), live streaming with tips (Zap.stream), decentralized marketplaces, or the variety of specialized clients for different use cases.

## üéØ Practical Assessment

### Demonstrate Your Skills

Complete these tasks to show you've mastered Module 1 concepts:

#### Task 1: Explain to a Friend
**Objective:** Test your understanding by teaching others

**Instructions:**
1. Find someone who hasn't heard of Nostr
2. Explain in simple terms:
   - Why current social media has problems
   - How Nostr is different
   - Why this matters for the future
3. Answer their questions without using technical jargon

**Success Criteria:** They understand the basic value proposition

#### Task 2: Network Effect Demo
**Objective:** Show true understanding of interoperability

**Instructions:**
1. Post something on one Nostr client
2. Show the same post appearing in a different client
3. Have a conversation that spans multiple clients
4. Demonstrate following someone from one app and seeing them in another

**Success Criteria:** You can confidently demonstrate how the network works

#### Task 3: Ecosystem Navigation
**Objective:** Prove familiarity with the broader ecosystem

**Instructions:**
1. Find and try one specialized Nostr application (not just social media)
2. Identify what makes it unique
3. Explain how it benefits from being built on Nostr vs. being a traditional app

**Success Criteria:** You understand how different applications leverage the protocol

## ü§î Reflection Questions

### Deep Thinking

Take 5-10 minutes to reflect on these questions:

1. **Personal Impact:** How might widespread adoption of decentralized protocols like Nostr change your own internet experience?

2. **Social Change:** What aspects of society could be positively impacted by moving away from centralized platforms?

3. **Challenges:** What do you think are the biggest obstacles to mainstream adoption of Nostr?

4. **Future Vision:** If Nostr succeeds, what might the internet look like in 10 years?

5. **Your Role:** How might you personally contribute to or benefit from the growing Nostr ecosystem?

### Portfolio Entry

**Create a brief write-up (2-3 paragraphs) covering:**

- What you learned about the problems with centralization
- Your experience using Nostr applications
- What excites you most about the ecosystem
- Questions you still have as you continue learning

This will be useful to look back on as you progress through the remaining modules.
