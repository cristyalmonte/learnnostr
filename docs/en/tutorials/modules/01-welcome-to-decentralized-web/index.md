# Module 1: Welcome to the Decentralized Web üåê

!!! info "Module Overview"
    **Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
    **Prerequisites:** None (complete beginner friendly)  
    **Skill Level:** Foundation
    **Module Type:** Understanding & Context

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- [ ] Explain the key problems with centralized social media platforms
- [ ] Define what decentralization means in practical terms
- [ ] Describe Nostr's core principles and unique value proposition  
- [ ] Navigate and use basic Nostr applications confidently
- [ ] Articulate why decentralized protocols matter for the future

## Why Start Here?

Before diving into technical details, it's crucial to understand *why* Nostr exists. This module provides the foundation for everything else you'll learn by helping you understand the problems Nostr solves and the vision it represents.

## Lessons in This Module

### üìö Lesson 1: Problems with Centralization
**Time:** 30 minutes ‚Ä¢ **Type:** Understanding

Learn about the fundamental issues with traditional social media platforms that led to the creation of protocols like Nostr.

[Start Lesson 1 ‚Üí](problems-with-centralization.md)

### üîç Lesson 2: Exploring Nostr Applications  
**Time:** 45 minutes ‚Ä¢ **Type:** Hands-on

Get hands-on experience with Nostr by trying different applications and seeing the protocol in action.

### üåç Lesson 3: The Nostr Ecosystem
**Time:** 45 minutes ‚Ä¢ **Type:** Understanding

Understand the broader ecosystem, who's building what, and the future potential of decentralized protocols.

## Hands-on Project

**Create Your First Nostr Experience**

You'll set up accounts on 2-3 different Nostr clients, follow some interesting accounts, and make your first posts. This gives you practical experience with the user-facing side before learning the technical details.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you'll have:
- Active accounts on multiple Nostr clients
- A basic understanding of how decentralized social networking feels different
- A foundation for understanding the technical concepts in later modules
- Confidence to explore the Nostr ecosystem independently
