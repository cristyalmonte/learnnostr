# Relays: The Infrastructure of Nostr

!!! info "Learning Objectives"
    After this lesson, you'll understand:
    
    - What relays are and how they work
    - The relay-client communication protocol
    - Different types of relays and their purposes
    - How to choose and manage relays
    - Relay policies and limitations

## What are Relays?

Relays are the servers that form the backbone of the Nostr network. They store, forward, and serve events to clients. Unlike traditional social media where one company controls all the servers, Nostr's relay system is decentralized - anyone can run a relay.

### Key Characteristics

- **Simple servers**: Store and forward JSON events
- **WebSocket-based**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **No complex logic**: Focus on data storage and delivery
- **Interchangeable**: Clients can use any relay
- **Independently operated**: Different people run different relays

## How Relays Work

### Basic Functions

1. **Accept events** from clients
2. **Store events** (temporarily or permanently)
3. **Forward events** to subscribed clients
4. **Filter requests** based on client queries
5. **Enforce policies** (rate limiting, content rules, etc.)

### Relay-Client Communication

Communication happens over WebSocket connections using simple JSON messages:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Client] <-->|WebSocket| B[Relay]
    B --> C[Event Storage]
    B --> D[Other Clients]
    A --> E[Publish Events]
    A --> F[Subscribe to Events]
    A --> G[Query Events]
```

## Message Types

### Client to Relay Messages

#### **EVENT** - Publishing Events
```json
["EVENT", {
  "id": "event-id",
  "pubkey": "author-pubkey",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [],
  "content": "Hello Nostr!",
  "sig": "signature"
}]
```

#### **REQ** - Subscribing to Events
```json
["REQ", "subscription-id", {
  "kinds": [1],
  "authors": ["pubkey1", "pubkey2"],
  "since": 1234567890,
  "limit": 100
}]
```

#### **CLOSE** - Closing Subscriptions
```json
["CLOSE", "subscription-id"]
```

#### **AUTH** - Authentication
```json
["AUTH", {
  "id": "challenge-event-id",
  "pubkey": "client-pubkey",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "kind": 22242,
  "tags": [["challenge", "challenge-string"]],
  "content": "",
  "sig": "signature"
}]
```

#### **COUNT** - Requesting Event Counts
```json
["COUNT", "subscription-id", {
  "kinds": [1],
  "authors": ["pubkey"]
}]
```

### Relay to Client Messages

#### **EVENT** - Sending Events
```json
["EVENT", "subscription-id", {
  "id": "event-id",
  "pubkey": "author-pubkey",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [],
  "content": "Hello Nostr!",
  "sig": "signature"
}]
```

#### **EOSE** - End of Stored Events
```json
["EOSE", "subscription-id"]
```

#### **OK** - Event Acceptance Response
```json
["OK", "event-id", true, ""]
["OK", "event-id", false, "blocked: content policy violation"]
```

#### **CLOSED** - Subscription Closed
```json
["CLOSED", "subscription-id", "rate-limited: too many subscriptions"]
```

#### **NOTICE** - Human-Readable Messages
```json
["NOTICE", "This relay requires authentication"]
```

#### **AUTH** - Authentication Challenge
```json
["AUTH", "challenge-string"]
```

#### **COUNT** - Event Count Response
```json
["COUNT", "subscription-id", {"count": 42}]
```

## Relay Information Document (NIP-11)

Relays can provide metadata about their capabilities:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/nostr+json" https://relay.example.com
```

```json
{
  "name": "My Nostr Relay",
  "description": "A relay for the Nostr community",
  "pubkey": "relay-admin-pubkey",
  "contact": "admin@relay.example.com",
  "supported_nips": [1, 2, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20, 22],

    "max_limit": 5000,
    "max_subid_length": 100,
    "max_event_tags": 100,
    "max_content_length": 8196,
    "min_pow_difficulty": 0,
    "auth_required": false,
