# Understanding NIPs (Nostr Implementation Possibilities)

NIPs are the backbone of Nostr's extensibility and standardization. They define how different parts of the protocol work and enable interoperability between clients and relays.

## What are NIPs?

**NIP** stands for **Nostr Implementation Possibility**. NIPs are technical specifications that describe:

- Protocol features and extensions
- Event formats and structures
- Client and relay behaviors
- Cryptographic standards
- Communication patterns

Think of NIPs as the "rules of the game" that all Nostr applications follow to ensure they can work together seamlessly.

## Why NIPs Matter

### ðŸ”— **Interoperability**
NIPs ensure that a note posted from Damus can be read on Amethyst, Iris, or any other Nostr client.

### ðŸš€ **Innovation**
New features can be proposed, tested, and standardized through the NIP process.

### ðŸ“‹ **Standardization**
Common patterns and best practices are documented for developers.

### ðŸ”„ **Evolution**
The protocol can evolve while maintaining backward compatibility.

## NIP Categories

### Core NIPs (Essential)

#### **NIP-01: Basic Protocol Flow**
The foundation of Nostr - defines events, signatures, and basic communication.

```json
{
  "id": "event-id",
  "pubkey": "author-pubkey",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [],
  "content": "Hello Nostr!",
  "sig": "signature"
}
```

#### **NIP-02: Contact List and Petnames**
Defines how users follow each other and manage contact lists.

```json
{
  "kind": 3,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "pubkey1", "relay-url", "alice"],
    ["p", "pubkey2", "relay-url", "bob"]
  ],
  "content": ""
}
```

#### **NIP-04: Encrypted Direct Messages**
Enables private messaging between users.

```json
{
  "kind": 4,
  "tags": [["p", "recipient-pubkey"]],
  "content": "encrypted-message-content"
}
```

### Event Types (Kind Numbers)

#### **Text Notes (Kind 1)**
```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "content": "This is a text note"
}
```

#### **Metadata (Kind 0)**
```json
{
  "kind": 0,
  "content": "{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"about\":\"Nostr enthusiast\"}"
}
```

#### **Reactions (Kind 7)**
```json
{
  "kind": 7,
  "tags": [["e", "note-id"], ["p", "author-pubkey"]],
  "content": "ðŸ¤™"
}
```

### Advanced NIPs

#### **NIP-09: Event Deletion**
Allows users to request deletion of their events.

```json
{
  "kind": 5,
  "tags": [["e", "event-to-delete-id"]],
  "content": "Deleting this note"
}
```

#### **NIP-10: Text Note References**
Standardizes how to reference other notes and create threads.

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "root-event-id", "", "root"],
    ["e", "reply-to-id", "", "reply"],
    ["p", "mentioned-pubkey"]
  ],
  "content": "This is a reply"
}
```

#### **NIP-23: Long-form Content**
Enables publishing articles and long-form content.

```json
{
  "kind": 30023,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "article-identifier"],
    ["title", "My Article Title"],
    ["summary", "Article summary"]
  ],
  "content": "# Article Content\n\nThis is a long article..."
}
```

## Lightning Integration NIPs

### **NIP-57: Lightning Zaps**
Enables Bitcoin Lightning payments (zaps) on Nostr.

```json
{
  "kind": 9735,
  "tags": [
    ["bolt11", "lightning-invoice"],
    ["description", "zap-request"],
    ["p", "recipient-pubkey"]
  ]
}
```

### **NIP-47: Wallet Connect**
Allows remote wallet control for Lightning payments.

## Relay NIPs

### **NIP-11: Relay Information Document**
Relays provide metadata about their capabilities.

```json
{
  "name": "My Relay",
  "description": "A Nostr relay",
  "pubkey": "relay-pubkey",
  "contact": "admin@relay.com",
  "supported_nips": [1, 2, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20, 22],
  "software": "strfry",
  "version": "0.9.6"
}
```

### **NIP-20: Command Results**
Standardizes relay responses to client commands.

```json
["OK", "event-id", true, ""]
["OK", "event-id", false, "blocked: content policy violation"]
```

## Client NIPs

### **NIP-07: Browser Extension Interface**
Defines how web clients interact with browser extensions for key management.

```javascript
// Request signing from extension
const event = await window.nostr.signEvent({
  kind: 1,
  created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  tags: [],
  content: "Hello from browser!"
})
```

### **NIP-19: Bech32-encoded Entities**
Defines human-readable identifiers for Nostr entities.

```
npub1... (public key)
nsec1... (private key)  
note1... (note ID)
nprofile1... (profile with relay hints)
nevent1... (event with relay hints)
```

## Specialized NIPs

### **NIP-26: Delegated Event Signing**
Allows delegation of signing authority to other keys.

### **NIP-28: Public Chat**
Defines public chat rooms and channels.

### **NIP-40: Expiration Timestamp**
Events can specify when they should expire.

### **NIP-42: Authentication of Clients to Relays**
Enables authenticated connections to relays.

1. **Abstract** - Brief summary
2. **Motivation** - Why it's needed
3. **Specification** - Technical details
4. **Examples** - Code samples
5. **Implementation** - Notes for developers

### Example NIP Structure

```

## Implementing NIPs

### For Developers

1. **Choose relevant NIPs** for your application
2. **Read specifications** carefully
3. **Implement incrementally** starting with core NIPs
4. **Test interoperability** with other clients
5. **Contribute feedback** to improve specifications

### Core NIPs to Implement

**Minimum viable client:**
- NIP-01 (Basic protocol)
- NIP-02 (Contact lists)
- NIP-19 (Bech32 encoding)

**Enhanced client:**

## NIP Compatibility

### Client Compatibility
Check which NIPs a client supports:

```javascript
// Many clients expose supported NIPs
const supportedNIPs = client.getSupportedNIPs()
console.log(supportedNIPs) // [1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 25, ...]
```

### Relay Compatibility
Query relay information:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/nostr+json" https://relay.example.com
```

## Future NIPs

The Nostr protocol continues to evolve with new NIPs being proposed for:

- **Enhanced privacy** (better encryption, metadata protection)
- **Scalability** (efficient data sync, caching strategies)
- **Rich media** (video, audio, file sharing)
- **Decentralized identity** (verification, reputation systems)
- **Economic features** (marketplaces, subscriptions)

## Contributing to NIPs

!!! info "Stay Updated"
    NIPs are constantly evolving. Follow the GitHub repository and join community discussions to stay informed about new developments and proposals.

!!! tip "Implementation Strategy"
    Start with core NIPs (1, 2, 19) and gradually add more advanced features. Focus on interoperability and user experience over feature completeness.
