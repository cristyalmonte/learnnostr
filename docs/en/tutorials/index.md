## üéØ Learning Paths by Goal

### I Want to Use Nostr
**Recommended:** [Module 1](modules/01-welcome-to-decentralized-web/) ‚Üí [Module 2](modules/02-digital-identity-security/)

Start with understanding what makes Nostr special, then learn to use it safely and effectively.

### I Want to Understand the Technology  
**Recommended:** Modules 1-5

Get a comprehensive understanding of how Nostr works without diving into code.

### I Want to Build Applications
**Recommended:** Full learning path (Modules 1-7) or [Simple Client Tutorial](simple-client.md)

Either follow the structured path for comprehensive knowledge, or jump straight into building if you have development experience.

### I Want to Run Infrastructure
**Recommended:** Full learning path (all 8 modules)

Understanding the full ecosystem is crucial before operating infrastructure that others depend on.

### I Want to Contribute to the Protocol
**Recommended:** Full learning path + community engagement

Protocol development requires deep understanding of technical and social aspects.
