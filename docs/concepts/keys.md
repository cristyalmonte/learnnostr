# Keys and Identity in Nostr

!!! info "Learning Objectives"
    After this lesson, you'll understand:
    
    - How cryptographic keys work in Nostr
    - The difference between private and public keys
    - Key formats and encoding (hex, npub, nsec)
    - Best practices for key management
    - How identity works without usernames

## Introduction

In Nostr, your identity is entirely based on cryptographic keys. Unlike traditional social media where you create an account with a username and password, Nostr uses public-key cryptography to establish and verify your identity.

## Understanding Cryptographic Keys

### What are Cryptographic Keys?

Cryptographic keys are pairs of mathematically related numbers used for:

- **Authentication**: Proving you are who you claim to be
- **Digital Signatures**: Ensuring messages haven't been tampered with
- **Encryption**: Keeping communications private (optional in Nostr)

### The Key Pair

Every Nostr identity consists of two keys:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Private Key] -->|generates| B[Public Key]
    A -->|signs| C[Events]
    B -->|verifies| C
    B -->|identifies| D[Your Identity]
```

## Private vs Public Keys: The Essential Difference

Understanding the difference between private and public keys is crucial for using Nostr safely and effectively.

### Private Keys: Your Secret Identity

Your private key is like a **master password** that controls your entire Nostr identity.

#### **What it does:**
- **Signs events** - Proves you authored a message
- **Controls identity** - Only you can post as "you"
- **Enables authentication** - Proves ownership of your account
- **Cannot be recovered** - If lost, your identity is gone forever

#### **Security Rules:**
- ‚ùå **NEVER share** with anyone
- ‚ùå **NEVER post** publicly or in messages
- ‚ùå **NEVER store** in plain text
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS backup** securely
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS encrypt** when storing

#### **Think of it like:**
- Your house key - only you should have it
- Your signature - uniquely identifies you
- Your bank PIN - gives access to everything

### Public Keys: Your Public Identity

Your public key is your **address** on Nostr - it's how others find and verify you.

#### **What it does:**
- **Identifies you** - Your unique address on Nostr
- **Verifies signatures** - Others can confirm your messages are authentic
- **Enables discovery** - People can find and follow you
- **Safe to share** - No security risk in sharing

#### **Sharing Rules:**
- ‚úÖ **Safe to share** publicly
- ‚úÖ **Post in bio** or profiles
- ‚úÖ **Share in messages** 
- ‚úÖ **Display on websites**
- ‚úÖ **Include in QR codes**

#### **Think of it like:**
- Your email address - others need it to contact you
- Your phone number - safe to share, identifies you
- Your mailing address - public information

### The Mathematical Relationship

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Private Key<br/>üîê Secret] -->|generates| B[Public Key<br/>üåê Public]
    A -->|signs| C[Message]
    B -->|verifies| C
    C -->|authentic?| D{‚úì Valid}
```

Private and public keys are mathematically linked:
- **One-way relationship**: Private key generates public key
- **Cannot reverse**: Public key cannot reveal private key
- **Cryptographic proof**: Signatures prove private key ownership

### Real-World Analogy

Think of it like a **wax seal** system:

- **Private Key** = Your unique seal stamp (keep secret!)
- **Public Key** = The pattern your seal makes (everyone can see)
- **Signature** = Pressing your seal on a document
- **Verification** = Others checking if the seal pattern matches yours

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

!!! danger "Critical Errors"
    
    **Sharing Private Keys**
    ```
    ‚ùå "Here's my nsec1abc123..." (NEVER DO THIS!)
    ‚úÖ "Here's my npub1xyz789..." (Safe to share)
    ```
    
    **Confusing Key Types**
    ```
    ‚ùå Posting private key thinking it's public
    ‚ùå Trying to follow someone using their private key
    ‚úÖ Always double-check key prefixes (nsec vs npub)
    ```
    
    **Insecure Storage**
    ```
    ‚ùå Saving private key in notes app
    ‚ùå Emailing private key to yourself
    ‚úÖ Using secure password managers or hardware wallets
    ```

## Private Keys

Your private key is the **secret** that proves ownership of your identity.

### Characteristics

- **Secret**: Never share this with anyone
- **Unique**: Each private key is randomly generated
- **Powerful**: Can create signatures for any event
- **Irreplaceable**: If lost, your identity is lost forever

### Format Examples

=== "Hex Format"

    ```
    d63b64d9c2c4f8c7b8e9f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2
    ```

=== "nsec Format (Bech32)"

    ```
    nsec1mclkfkwu2n7v0wuwn6d2kwx56mn0029ceuxr6ul6xjm2k6l7qxsqrxqhp8
    ```

### Generating a Private Key

=== "JavaScript"

    ```javascript
    import { generatePrivateKey } from 'nostr-tools'
    
    const privateKey = generatePrivateKey()
    console.log('Private key:', privateKey)
    // Output: d63b64d9c2c4f8c7b8e9f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from nostr.key import PrivateKey
    
    private_key = PrivateKey()
    print(f"Private key: {private_key.hex()}")
    // Output: d63b64d9c2c4f8c7b8e9f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2
    ```

=== "Rust"

    ```rust
    use nostr_sdk::prelude::*;
    
    let keys = Keys::generate();
    println!("Private key: {}", keys.secret_key().display_secret());
    ```

## Public Keys

Your public key is your **identity** in Nostr - it's how others recognize you.

### Characteristics

- **Public**: Safe to share with everyone
- **Derived**: Mathematically derived from your private key
- **Immutable**: Always the same for a given private key
- **Verifiable**: Others can verify your signatures with it

### Format Examples

=== "Hex Format"

    ```
    02a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2
    ```

=== "npub Format (Bech32)"

    ```
    npub15xdvv02wuha0hpkx6x0z7g3mgh4w0l9fxqcr6nxvhm2k6l7qxsqg8t5c4
    ```

### Deriving Public Key

=== "JavaScript"

    ```javascript
    import { getPublicKey, nip19 } from 'nostr-tools'
    
    const privateKey = 'd63b64d9c2c4f8c7b8e9f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2'
    const publicKey = getPublicKey(privateKey)
    
    console.log('Public key (hex):', publicKey)
    console.log('Public key (npub):', nip19.npubEncode(publicKey))
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from nostr.key import PrivateKey
    
    private_key = PrivateKey.from_hex('d63b64d9c2c4f8c7b8e9f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2')
    public_key = private_key.public_key
    
    print(f"Public key (hex): {public_key.hex()}")
    print(f"Public key (npub): {public_key.bech32()}")
    ```

## Key Formats and Encoding

Nostr uses different formats for displaying keys to users:

### Hex Format
- **Raw format**: 64 character hexadecimal string
- **Use case**: Internal processing, APIs
- **Example**: `d63b64d9c2c4f8c7b8e9f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2`

### Bech32 Format (NIP-19)
- **User-friendly**: Includes checksums and prefixes
- **Private keys**: Start with `nsec1`
- **Public keys**: Start with `npub1`
- **Benefits**: Error detection, easier to copy/paste

!!! tip "Format Conversion"
    Most Nostr libraries provide functions to convert between formats:
    
    ```javascript
    import { nip19 } from 'nostr-tools'
    
    // Hex to bech32
    const npub = nip19.npubEncode(hexPublicKey)
    const nsec = nip19.nsecEncode(hexPrivateKey)
    
    // Bech32 to hex
    const { type, data } = nip19.decode(npub)
    ```

## Digital Signatures

Your private key is used to create digital signatures that prove authenticity:

### How Signatures Work

1. **Create Event**: You compose a message or event
2. **Hash Content**: The event content is hashed
3. **Sign Hash**: Your private key signs the hash
4. **Attach Signature**: The signature is included with the event
5. **Verify**: Others use your public key to verify the signature

### Example: Signing an Event

=== "JavaScript"

    ```javascript
    import { finishEvent } from 'nostr-tools'
    
    const event = {
        kind: 1,
        created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
        tags: [],
        content: 'Hello Nostr!'
    }
    
    const signedEvent = finishEvent(event, privateKey)
    console.log('Signed event:', signedEvent)
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from nostr.event import Event
    from nostr.key import PrivateKey
    import time
    
    private_key = PrivateKey()
    
    event = Event(
        kind=1,
        content="Hello Nostr!",
        created_at=int(time.time())
    )
    
    private_key.sign_event(event)
    print(f"Signed event: {event.to_json()}")
    ```

## Identity Without Usernames

### Traditional vs Nostr Identity

| Traditional Social Media | Nostr |
|--------------------------|-------|
| Username + Password | Cryptographic Keys |
| Platform controls identity | You control identity |
| Can be banned/suspended | Censorship resistant |
| Tied to one platform | Portable across clients |
| Password can be reset | Keys cannot be recovered |

### Benefits of Cryptographic Identity

!!! success "Advantages"
    
    - **True Ownership**: You own your identity, not a platform
    - **Portability**: Use the same identity across all Nostr clients
    - **Censorship Resistance**: No central authority can ban you
    - **Verification**: Cryptographic proof of authenticity
    - **Privacy**: No personal information required

!!! warning "Responsibilities"
    
    - **Key Security**: You must protect your private key
    - **No Recovery**: Lost keys mean lost identity
    - **Backup Important**: Always backup your keys securely

## Key Management Best Practices

### Secure Storage

!!! danger "Never Do This"
    
    - Store private keys in plain text files
    - Share private keys via email or messaging
    - Use the same key across multiple devices without encryption
    - Store keys in browser localStorage without encryption

!!! success "Best Practices"
    
    - Use hardware wallets when possible
    - Encrypt private keys with strong passwords
    - Use secure key management software
    - Create offline backups in multiple locations
    - Consider using key derivation for multiple identities

### Key Backup Strategies

=== "Paper Backup"

    ```
    1. Write down your private key (nsec format)
    2. Store in a fireproof safe
    3. Consider multiple copies in different locations
    4. Use tamper-evident storage
    ```

=== "Digital Backup"

    ```
    1. Encrypt with strong password
    2. Store on multiple devices
    3. Use cloud storage with encryption
    4. Regular backup verification
    ```

=== "Hardware Wallet"

    ```
    1. Use dedicated hardware device
    2. Secure with PIN/passphrase
    3. Backup seed phrase securely
    4. Test recovery process
    ```

## Multiple Identities

You can have multiple Nostr identities for different purposes:

### Use Cases

- **Personal**: Your main social identity
- **Professional**: Work-related content
- **Anonymous**: Privacy-focused interactions
- **Bot**: Automated accounts
- **Testing**: Development and experimentation

### Managing Multiple Keys

=== "JavaScript"

    ```javascript
    class NostrIdentityManager {
        constructor() {
            this.identities = new Map()
        }
        
        createIdentity(name) {
            const privateKey = generatePrivateKey()
            const publicKey = getPublicKey(privateKey)
            
            this.identities.set(name, {
                privateKey,
                publicKey,
                npub: nip19.npubEncode(publicKey)
            })
            
            return this.identities.get(name)
        }
        
        getIdentity(name) {
            return this.identities.get(name)
        }
        
        listIdentities() {
            return Array.from(this.identities.keys())
        }
    }
    ```

## Interactive Exercise

Let's practice working with keys:

!!! example "Try This"
    
    1. Generate a new key pair
    2. Convert between hex and bech32 formats
    3. Create and sign a simple event
    4. Verify the signature
    
    Use the code examples above to experiment with key generation and signing.

## Common Pitfalls

!!! warning "Avoid These Mistakes"
    
    **Key Confusion**
    - Mixing up private and public keys
    - Using wrong key formats
    - Sharing private keys accidentally
    
    **Security Issues**
    - Storing keys insecurely
