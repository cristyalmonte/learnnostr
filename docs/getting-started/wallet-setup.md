    - Why you need a Lightning wallet for Nostr
    - Different types of Lightning wallets available
    - How to choose the right wallet for your needs
    - How to connect your wallet to Nostr clients

## Why Do You Need a Lightning Wallet?

A **Lightning wallet** enables you to send and receive **zaps** - instant Bitcoin payments that are a core part of the Nostr social experience. Zaps allow you to:

- ‚ö° **Tip creators** for great content
- üéØ **Show appreciation** with micro-payments
- üí∞ **Monetize your content** by receiving zaps
- üöÄ **Boost signal** on important posts
- ü§ù **Support the ecosystem** with value-for-value interactions

!!! tip "Zaps vs Traditional Social Media"
    Instead of "likes" that cost nothing, zaps let you put real value behind your appreciation. Even small amounts (1-100 sats) create meaningful economic signals.
